## Overview

This project was the first one that I've built from scratch with React applying what I've been studying last months. Furthermore, also was the first where I created an entire prototype using Figma.
For style I used the Tailwind, one of the most famous  css framework nowadays.

## Prototype

I don't be a designer, but I like design and experiment some tools because they helps to create interfaces visually attractive. One of the most famous tool to prototype web interfaces is Figma and I totally enjoyed to try it.

## React

React is a library for creating visual interfaces with Javascript. One of its main principles it is componentization and you can view this by overlooking that I divide each screen as a component, as well as the cards at the second.
Moreover, I builded the project using the JSX javascript extension which provides a better way of building the elements.

Here an example of JSX syntax
```jsx
const title = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

## Vite

I tried to combine React with some featured technologies like Vite. Vite is a frontend build tooling that aims to improve web development by providing a faster development experience. Using Vite your project will be created fastly than the React default implementation one.
